# Ideas for getting the data #
##############################

For model: 
* Using a "feature-extractor" pipeline with a model to extract the features
* Load a pretrained model, and sending it inputs and get the outputs.

For Data: 
* There are audio emotion datasets
* once we get the high-dim vector from the encoder, we can write to a csv file
* we can then load it as a dataset and dataloader or do whatever we want with it for the actual classification task we choose to do.
